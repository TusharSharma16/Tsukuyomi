The system is divided into a multilayered architecture comprimising of a web based front end designed using Bootstrap 4, Python + Flask as the HTTP server and router, and MySQL server for the database. The requests handled by front end Javascript are served by a Python server running Flask as the application framework.

All HTTP requests to Flask are made via encrypted POST messages. The system is designed to be secure, robust and flexible. The requirements mandated the use of a stored procedure and a trigger in MySQL. The schema follows third NF normalization form.
