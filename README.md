The system is divided into a multilayered architecture comprimising of a web based front end designed using Bootstrap 4, Python + Flask as the HTTP server and router, and MySQL server for the database. The requests handled by front end Javascript are served by a Python server running Flask as the application framework. Python library of MySQL connector has been extensively utilised to function as a query manager for the relational database framework

The system provides movie recommendations using Collaborative Filtering technique and an onsite booking and management system for a theatre (franchise). The stakeholders takein into consideration are the cashier at the booking kiosk, who books tickets in exchange for payment, and the other being the manager who has the power of defining statistics, change prices, schedules movies, and adds new movies that are to be premiered.

All HTTP requests to Flask are made via encrypted POST messages. The system is designed to be secure, robust and flexible. The requirements mandated the use of a stored procedure and a trigger in MySQL. The schema follows third NF normalization form.
